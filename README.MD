# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). On the index of URLs, there is a username column intended for future functionality. Ideally, a logged-in user would be able to see the short-urls from any other registered user, but only be able to delete or update their own.
